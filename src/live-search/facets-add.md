Any filterable product attribute can be used as a facet. The _Add facets_ panel lists the current facets and makes it easy to assign additional product attributes. Adding a facet is a three-step process.

_Add facet_
## Step 1: Add a facet

1. In the Admin, go to **Marketing** > SEO & Search > **Live Search**.
1. On the _Faceting_ tab, click <span class="btn">Add facets</span>.
1. In the _Add facets_ list, each available attribute has a separate _Add_ button. Do one of the following:

     - In the _Faceting Attributes_ list, choose the product attribute that you want to use as a facet and click <span class="btn">Add</span>.
     - To find a specific product attribute, enter the first few characters of the attribute name in the _Search_ box. Then, click <span class="btn">Add</span>.

     To learn more, go to [Facet Types]({% link live-search/facets-type.md %}).

     The facet is added to the bottom of the _Dynamic Facets_ list and the _Publish changes_ button becomes available.

1. If the facet you want to add can't be found, go to **Stores** > Attributes > **Product** and verify that the attribute has the [required properties]({% link live-search/facets.md %}) to be used as a facet. If necessary, update the following storefront properties of the attribute:

     - Use in Search - `Yes`
     - Use in Search Results Layered Navigation - `Yes`
     - Use in Layered Navigation - `Filterable (with results)`
     - Use in Search Results Layered Navigation - `Yes`. (Isn't this the same as Line 28? Delete?)

1. When prompted, refresh the cache.

   The facet becomes available in the storefront the next time the catalog is synchronized with Live Search. Depending on the [index mode]({% link system/index-management.md %}) that is set for the _Product Attributes Feed_, it can take some time for the updated attribute to appear in the list of available facets. For best results, set the index mode for the _Product Attribute Feed_ to `Update on Schedule`.

   If the facet isn't available after two hours, see [Verify Catalog Sync]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/config-connect.html) in the developer documentation.

## Step 2: Edit facet properties (Optional)

Refer to [Settings]({% link live-search/settings.md %}) to configure price faceting intervals and groupings.

1. If you need to edit the facet properties, click **More** (![More selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-more.png %})) options in the far-right column.
1. On the menu, click **Edit**. Then, adjust the following properties as needed.

     - Label - Enter the facet label that appears in the storefront.
     - Select type - The default single- or multi-select type is determined by the attribute properties. The logical operator (`or` or `and`) that is used with multi-select input types determines the set of products returned.
     - Sort type - Choose the method that is used to sort facet values. Options: Alphabetical, Count
     - Max Value - Enter the maximum number of facet values displayed in the storefront. Valid entries: 0 - 10

1. When complete, click **Save**.

   _Edit facet_

1. To pin the facet to the top of the _Filters_ list, click the gray pushpin (![Pin selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-pin-gray.png %})).
1. To change the order of the pinned facet, click the **Move** (![Move selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-move.png %})) icon and drag the row to a new position in the _Pinned Facets_ section.

## Step 3: Publish changes

1. When the facet is complete, click <span class="btn">Publish changes</span>.
1. Wait for the facet to appear in the store.

   If the facet isn't available after two hours, see [Verify catalog sync]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/config-connect.html) in the developer documentation.
